# 1) Give a pet its own prop of name
# 2) Give it a property of animal_type
# 3) animal_type needs to be an instance of a dog
# 4) Assign an owner via a method
# 5) \_\_str\_\_ return a string with pet's name, # of legs, and what it says

For those who would like the requirements for the other Classes:
Dog:
# Create a Dog class that:
# 1) Inherits from Animal
# 2) Has its own prop of "breed"
# 3) initializes the Animal class with'species', 'leg_num' and 'domesticated' attributes

#In main.py:
### Instantiate a new Dog and print out the results of making it speak
Then...when you're done with making your Pet class
### Create an instance of the Pet class and compose the Dog instance into it by adding the dog as a property of the new Pet
### Add an owner by calling your pet's set_owner method (or whatever you called it)
### Print a human-readable output thanks to our the __str__ method you defined in Pet
